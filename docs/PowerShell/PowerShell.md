## Code Examples
Please note all the code blocks I include are ran on Powershell 7+, the behaviour/output may be different when using a lower version.

I recommend running the blocks in your terminal/PowerShell, if you haven't used a command-line a lot before, the best way to learn is to get exposure. I used to be quite intimidated and scared of cli (command-line interfaces) at the start. It's a bit like being scared of the dark, you think there might be monsters coming to get you. But if you just start speding more time in the dark, you'll get more comfortable, the monsters will still be there, but maybe they'll seem chill.
