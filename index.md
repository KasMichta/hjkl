# Ayo
This is a blog centred around PowerShell script development (and some more stuff later on). Although many posts will consist of explanations, guides, and breakdowns (hopefully not of the mental kind), they are as much a attempt to erode my impostor syndrome as they are to helping beginners.

# PowerShell
The PowerShell articles are all intended to be accessible to most starting out with scripting and the PS command-line. The [Start Here] page is a good...start. However, there are articles that are not linked in that section, most of them are quite short and meant as a reference rather than an instructional guide, you can find all the articles in the sidebar. I will be adding and editing this over time, so if you do find something I got wrong or I wasn't clear on. Feel free to send me feedback on reddit: [my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/96MgXCfNblERwTp3XB)
